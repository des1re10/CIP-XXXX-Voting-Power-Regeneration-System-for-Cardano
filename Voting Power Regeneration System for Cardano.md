# CIP-XXXX: UTXO-based Voting Power Regeneration System for Cardano```yamlCIP: CIP-XXXXTitle: UTXO-based Voting Power Regeneration SystemAuthor: M.Eng. Robert LedwigStatus: DraftCategory: GovernanceCreated: 2024-12-18Discussions-to: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/discussions/953License: CC-BY-4.0```## AbstractThis CIP proposes a comprehensive voting power system based on Cardano's UTXO model. The system introduces an innovative approach where voters can utilize their full voting power immediately but must observe a regeneration period afterward. All tracking occurs at the UTXO level, ensuring a tamper-proof and transparent governance mechanism that aligns with Cardano's fundamental design principles.## MotivationCurrent blockchain governance systems face several critical vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:1. **Concentration of Voting Power**   - Large stakeholders can dominate governance decisions   - Whales can repeatedly influence multiple proposals in short timeframes   - Lack of mechanisms to prevent voting power accumulation2. **Limited Small Holder Participation**   - High barriers to entry for smaller ADA holders   - Complexity of voting systems discourages participation   - Insufficient incentives for consistent involvement3. **Thoughtful Voting Incentives**   - Current systems may encourage rushed decision-making   - No mechanisms to promote careful consideration of proposals   - Limited consequences for arbitrary voting patterns4. **UTXO-level Tracking Requirements**   - Need for granular tracking of voting power usage   - Importance of maintaining complete voting history   - Challenges in preventing UTXO manipulation5. **Chain Reorganization Impacts**   - Potential loss or duplication of votes during chain reorgs   - Complexity in maintaining consistent voting records   - Need for robust state recovery mechanismsThe proposed system addresses these challenges through several innovative mechanisms:- **Regeneration Periods**: Introduces mandatory waiting periods after voting that affect all participants equally, preventing rapid-fire voting by large stakeholders while maintaining fairness across all holder sizes.- **Anti-Gaming Controls**: Implements sophisticated controls on UTXO splitting and delegation to prevent system exploitation, including:  - Maximum split depths  - Cooldown periods  - Minimum UTXO sizes  - Delegation caps- **Transparent History**: Creates an immutable and verifiable voting history through comprehensive UTXO tracking, ensuring full accountability and auditability of all voting actions.- **Reorg Protection**: Provides robust mechanisms for handling chain reorganizations, including:  - State backups  - UTXO lineage tracking  - Emergency vote protection  - Automatic state recovery procedures- **Emergency Handling**: Enforces clear rules for emergency proposals while maintaining system integrity through:  - Validator requirements  - Shortened voting periods  - Enhanced security measures  - Strict qualification criteria## Specification### Core MechanismThe core mechanism introduces a sophisticated voting power regeneration system that operates at the UTXO level with comprehensive anti-gaming protections. This system manages voting power through a combination of immediate availability and controlled regeneration, ensuring both flexibility and security.#### UTXO-based Voting Power CalculationThe voting power calculation system determines a UTXO's effective voting power through a comprehensive multi-factor model that considers various aspects of the UTXO's history and current state.##### Core Components1. **Base Voting Power (`BaseVotingPower`)**   - Derived directly from the UTXO's ADA value in lovelace   - Forms the foundation for all subsequent calculations   - Represents the maximum potential voting power of the UTXO2. **Regeneration Factor (`RegenerationFactor`)**   - Scales from 0 to 1 based on time since last vote   - Calculated as: `min(1.0, (CurrentSlot - lastVoteSlot) / RegenerationPeriod)`   - Ensures voting power recovers gradually after use   - Full regeneration occurs over one epoch   - Prevents rapid successive voting while maintaining long-term influence3. **Split Penalty Factor (`SplitPenaltyFactor`)**   - Reduces voting power based on UTXO splitting history   - Calculated as: `1.0 - (splitDepth * SplitPenaltyRate)`   - Minimum value of 0.5 (maximum 50% penalty)   - Penalizes excessive UTXO splitting to prevent vote manipulation   - Inherited penalties persist through UTXO lineage4. **Delegation Factor (`DelegationFactor`)**   - Adjusts power based on delegation status   - Range: 0.8 to 1.0 (maximum 20% efficiency loss)   - Reflects the cost of delegating voting power   - Encourages direct participation while allowing flexibility5. **Emergency Factor (`EmergencyFactor`)**   - Multiplier for emergency proposal voting   - Range: 1.0 to 1.5 (up to 50% boost)   - Only applies during qualified emergency proposals   - Enables stronger response to critical situations##### Comprehensive FormulaThe final voting power is calculated through sequential application of all factors:```haskellVotingPower = BaseVotingPower * RegenerationFactor * SplitPenaltyFactor * DelegationFactor * EmergencyFactorwhere:BaseVotingPower = UTXO value in lovelaceRegenerationFactor ∈ [0, 1]      -- Time-based recoverySplitPenaltyFactor ∈ [0.5, 1]    -- Split depth penaltiesDelegationFactor ∈ [0.8, 1]      -- Delegation efficiencyEmergencyFactor ∈ [1, 1.5]       -- Emergency voting boostSystem Constants:RegenerationPeriod = EpochLength -- Full power recovery periodSplitPenaltyRate = 0.1          -- 10% penalty per split level```##### Detailed Examples1. **Fresh UTXO (Maximum Power)**```haskellScenario:- UTXO Value: 1000 ADA- No previous votes- No splits- Not delegated- Normal votingCalculation:BaseVotingPower    = 1000 ADARegenerationFactor = 1.0    -- Fully regeneratedSplitPenaltyFactor = 1.0    -- No split penaltiesDelegationFactor   = 1.0    -- Not delegatedEmergencyFactor    = 1.0    -- Normal votingFinal VotingPower = 1000 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 1.0 = 1000 ADA```2. **Split UTXO with Partial Regeneration**```haskellScenario:- UTXO Value: 500 ADA- One split level deep- 50% regenerated after voting- Not delegated- Normal votingCalculation:BaseVotingPower    = 500 ADARegenerationFactor = 0.5    -- Half regeneratedSplitPenaltyFactor = 0.9    -- 10% penalty for one splitDelegationFactor   = 1.0    -- Not delegatedEmergencyFactor    = 1.0    -- Normal votingFinal VotingPower = 500 * 0.5 * 0.9 * 1.0 * 1.0 = 225 ADA```3. **Emergency Voting with Delegation**```haskellScenario:- UTXO Value: 2000 ADA- No splits- Fully regenerated- Delegated- Emergency voting activeCalculation:BaseVotingPower    = 2000 ADARegenerationFactor = 1.0    -- Fully regeneratedSplitPenaltyFactor = 1.0    -- No splitsDelegationFactor   = 0.9    -- 10% delegation efficiency lossEmergencyFactor    = 1.5    -- Emergency multiplierFinal VotingPower = 2000 * 1.0 * 1.0 * 0.9 * 1.5 = 2700 ADA```##### Implementation Structure```haskelldata VotingPowerState = VotingPowerState {    -- Core voting power tracking    availablePower :: Value,    regenerationStatus :: Integer,  -- 0-100    lastVoteSlot :: SlotNo,        -- Anti-gaming protections    splitHistory :: SplitHistory,    inheritedPenalties :: Set Penalty,        -- Delegation tracking    delegatedPower :: Map Address

constraintscalculateEffectiveVotingPower :: VotingPowerState -> Value -> Either Error ValuecalculateEffectiveVotingPower state requestedAmount = do    -- Calculate base power from UTXO value    baseAmount <- calculateBasePower state.availablePower requestedAmount        -- Apply regeneration factor    regenerated <- applyRegeneration baseAmount state.regenerationStatus state.lastVoteSlot        -- Apply split penalties if any    splitAdjusted <- applySplitPenalties regenerated state.splitHistory        -- Apply delegation factor if delegated    delegationAdjusted <- applyDelegationFactor splitAdjusted state.delegationConstraints        -- Apply emergency factor if applicable    emergencyAdjusted <- applyEmergencyFactor delegationAdjusted state.emergencyVotingStatus        -- Verify against global caps    capChecked <- checkGlobalCaps emergencyAdjusted        pure capChecked```### Vote Validation and ProcessingThe vote
