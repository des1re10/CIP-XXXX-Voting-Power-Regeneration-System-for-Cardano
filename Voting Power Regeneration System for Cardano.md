The system introduces an innovative approach where voters can utilize their full voting power immediately but must observe a regeneration period afterward. All tracking occurs at the UTXO level, ensuring a tamper-proof and transparent governance mechanism that aligns with Cardano's fundamental design principles.## MotivationCurrent blockchain governance systems face several critical vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:1. **Concentration of Voting Power**   - Large stakeholders can dominate governance decisions   - Whales can repeatedly influence multiple proposals in short timeframes   - Lack of mechanisms to prevent voting power accumulation2. **Limited Small Holder Participation**   - High barriers to entry for smaller ADA holders   - Complexity of voting systems discourages participation   - Insufficient incentives for consistent involvement3. **Thoughtful Voting Incentives**   - Current systems may encourage rushed decision-making   - No mechanisms to promote careful consideration of proposals   - Limited consequences for arbitrary voting patterns4. **UTXO-level Tracking Requirements**   - Need for granular tracking of voting power usage   - Importance of maintaining complete voting history   - Challenges in preventing UTXO manipulation5. **Chain Reorganization Impacts**   - Potential loss or duplication of votes during chain reorgs   - Complexity in maintaining consistent voting records   - Need for robust state recovery mechanismsThe proposed system addresses these challenges through several innovative mechanisms:- **Regeneration Periods**: Introduces mandatory waiting periods after voting that affect all participants equally, preventing rapid-fire voting by large stakeholders while maintaining fairness across all holder sizes.- **Anti-Gaming Controls**: Implements sophisticated controls on UTXO splitting and delegation to prevent system exploitation, including:  - Maximum split depths  - Cooldown periods  - Minimum UTXO sizes  - Delegation caps- **Transparent History**: Creates an immutable and verifiable voting history through comprehensive UTXO tracking, ensuring full accountability and auditability of all voting actions.- **Reorg Protection**: Provides robust mechanisms for handling chain reorganizations, including:  - State backups  - UTXO lineage tracking  - Emergency vote protection  - Automatic state recovery procedures- **Emergency Handling**: Enforces clear rules for emergency proposals while maintaining system integrity through:  - Validator requirements  - Shortened voting periods  - Enhanced security measures  - Strict qualification criteria## Specification### Core MechanismThe core mechanism introduces a sophisticated voting power regeneration system that operates at the UTXO level with comprehensive anti-gaming protections. This system manages voting power through a combination of immediate availability and controlled regeneration, ensuring both flexibility and security.#### UTXO-based Voting Power Calculation```haskelldata VotingPowerState = VotingPowerState {    -- Core voting power tracking    availablePower :: Value,    regenerationStatus :: Integer,  -- 0-100    lastVoteSlot :: SlotNo,        -- Anti-gaming protections    splitHistory :: SplitHistory,    inheritedPenalties :: Set Penalty,        -- Delegation tracking    delegatedPower :: Map Address Value,    delegationConstraints :: DelegationConstraints,        -- Emergency voting state    emergencyVotingStatus :: EmergencyStatus}-- Calculate actual voting power with all constraintscalculateEffectiveVotingPower :: VotingPowerState -> Value -> Either Error ValuecalculateEffectiveVotingPower state requestedAmount = do    -- Check basic regeneration status    baseAmount <- checkRegenerationStatus state requestedAmount        -- Apply split penalties if any    splitAdjusted <- applySplitPenalties baseAmount state.splitHistory        -- Check delegation limits    delegationChecked <- checkDelegationLimits splitAdjusted state.delegationConstraints        -- Verify against global caps    capChecked <- checkGlobalCaps delegationChecked        pure capChecked```The voting power calculation system incorporates multiple layers of validation and adjustment:1. **Base Power Calculation**: Initial voting power is derived from UTXO value2. **Regeneration Adjustment**: Applied based on time since last vote3. **Split Penalty Application**: Reduces power based on UTXO splitting history4. **Delegation Verification**: Ensures delegation limits aren't exceeded5. **Global Cap Compliance**: Maintains system-wide voting power balance### Anti-Gaming Protections#### UTXO Split ControlsThe system implements comprehensive controls to prevent UTXO splitting attacks while maintaining legitimate use cases:```haskelldata SplitHistory = SplitHistory {    parentUtxo :: Maybe UTxORef,    splitDepth :: Integer,    lastSplitTime :: SlotNo,    childUtxos :: Set UTxORef,    splitPenalties :: Map UTxORef Penalty}data SplitConstraints = SplitConstraints {    -- Maximum split depth to prevent infinite splitting    maxSplitDepth :: Integer,  -- 2 levels maximum        -- Minimum time between splits    minSplitInterval :: Integer,  -- 72 hours in slots        -- Regeneration penalties per split level    splitPenalties :: Map Integer Integer,  -- depth -> penalty percentage        -- Minimum UTXO size after split    minSplitSize :: Value  -- 100 ADA}-- Validate and process UTXO splitsvalidateSplit :: UTxO -> [UTxO] -> SplitConstraints -> Either Error [UTxO]validateSplit parent children constraints = do    -- Check split depth    when (getSplitDepth parent >= constraints.maxSplitDepth) $        throwError MaxSplitDepthExceeded        -- Verify split interval    lastSplit <- getLastSplitTime parent    when (currentSlot - lastSplit < constraints.minSplitInterval) $        throwError SplitCooldownActive            -- Check minimum sizes    forM_ children $ \child ->         when (getValue child < constraints.minSplitSize) $            throwError UTxOTooSmall                -- Calculate and apply penalties    let penalties = calculateSplitPenalties parent children constraints    applyPenalties children penalties```#### Delegation Controls```haskelldata DelegationConstraints = DelegationConstraints {    -- Maximum delegation per delegator    maxDelegationPerAddress :: Value,  -- 100,000 ADA        -- Maximum total delegation per delegatee    maxDelegationPerDelegatee :: Value,  -- 5% of total stake        -- Global delegation cap    globalDelegationCap :: Value,  -- 20% of total stake        -- Minimum delegation period    minDelegationPeriod :: Integer,  -- 30 days in slots        -- Cooldown between delegation changes    delegationCooldown :: Integer  -- 72 hours in slots}-- Validate delegation changesvalidateDelegation :: DelegationRequest -> DelegationState -> Either Error DelegationStatevalidateDelegation request state = do    -- Check individual caps    when (request.amount > state.constraints.maxDelegationPerAddress) $        throwError DelegationAmountTooLarge            -- Verify delegatee capacity    totalDelegatee <- getTotalDelegatedTo request.delegatee    when (totalDelegatee + request.amount > state.constraints.maxDelegationPerDelegatee) $        throwError DelegateeCapacityExceeded            -- Check global cap    globalTotal <- getGlobalDelegationTotal    when (globalTotal + request.amount > state.constraints.globalDelegationCap) $        throwError GlobalDelegationCapExceeded            -- Verify cooldown period    lastChange <- getLastDelegationChange request.delegator    when (currentSlot - lastChange < state.constraints.delegationCooldown) $        throwError DelegationCooldownActive```### Emergency Proposal SystemThe emergency proposal system enables rapid response to critical situations while maintaining security and preventing abuse. The system classifies emergencies into distinct categories and enforces strict validation requirements.#### Emergency Classifications1. **Security Vulnerabilities**   - Critical protocol vulnerabilities   -

All UTXOs are inherently traceable on Cardano's blockchain   - Complete transaction history is publicly verifiable   - UTXO lineage can be deterministically tracked   - Manipulations are permanently visible on-chain      Potential Concerns:   - Complex UTXO splitting patterns for vote dilution attempts   - Short-term transaction timing strategies   - Temporary voting power distribution tactics      Native Protections:   - Full UTXO traceability on Cardano   - Immutable transaction history   - Public auditability of all operations   - Deterministic state verification      Additional Safeguards:   - Cooldown periods for major operations   - Minimum UTXO size requirements   - Basic split depth monitoring   - Transparent delegation tracking   Note: While UTXO manipulation tactics are possible, their effectiveness is significantly limited by Cardano's inherent UTXO traceability and immutable history. Any manipulation attempts leave permanent, traceable evidence on-chain.2. **Delegation Concentration**      Risk Level: Medium   Impact: High      Potential Issues:   - Power accumulation through delegation   - Delegation cartels   - Vote buying schemes   - Circular delegation patterns      Mitigations:   - Individual delegation caps   - Global delegation limits   - Minimum delegation periods   - Delegation cooldown enforcement   - Circular delegation detection   - Delegation pattern monitoring3. **Emergency Proposal Abuse**      Risk Level: Medium   Impact: Critical      Attack Vectors:   - False emergency declarations   - Validator collusion   - Timing manipulation   - Information withholding      Mitigations:   - Multiple validator requirements   - Strict condition verification   - Concurrent proposal limits   - Technical validation requirements   - Emergency vote monitoring   - Validator rotation system4. **Chain Reorganization**      Risk Level: Medium   Impact: High      Vulnerabilities:   - Vote loss during reorgs   - State inconsistency   - Double voting opportunities   - Transaction reordering      Mitigations:   - Complete state history maintenance   - UTXO lineage tracking   - Delegation state backups   - Emergency vote protection   - Transaction ordering rules   - State verification procedures### Operational Risks1. **System Performance**   - Transaction processing delays   - State growth management   - Resource utilization   - Network bandwidth requirements2. **User Experience**   - Interface complexity   - Transaction fee implications   - Voting power understanding   - Delegation management3. **Protocol Integration**   - Consensus compatibility   - Network upgrade coordination   - Parameter optimization   - Resource sharing## CopyrightThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.
