# CIP-XXXX: UTXO-based Voting Power Regeneration System## AbstractThis CIP proposes a voting power regeneration system based on Cardano's UTXO model. The system introduces variable regeneration periods based on proposal urgency, allowing faster recovery for critical decisions while maintaining longer cooldowns for standard governance.## MotivationCurrent blockchain governance systems face several challenges:1. Large stakeholders can repeatedly influence multiple proposals in short timeframes2. No mechanisms to encourage careful consideration of proposals3. Limited incentives for consistent, thoughtful participation4. One-size-fits-all voting periods don't account for proposal urgencyThis proposal addresses these challenges through a simple regeneration mechanism that adapts to proposal importance while affecting all participants equally.## Specification### Proposal CategoriesProposals are classified into three urgency levels:1. **Standard Proposals**   - Regular governance decisions   - Protocol improvements   - Long-term planning   - Default category for most proposals2. **Priority Proposals**   - Time-sensitive updates   - Important parameter adjustments   - Significant protocol enhancements3. **Emergency Proposals**   - Critical security fixes   - Severe bug patches   - Network stability issues   - Must be verified by multiple SPOs### Core MechanismThe system introduces a voting power regeneration mechanism with these key components:1. **Base Voting Power**   - Derived directly from UTXO's ADA value   - Forms the foundation for all calculations2. **Regeneration Factor**   - Scales from 0 to 1 based on time since last vote   - Calculated as: `min(1.0, (CurrentSlot - LastVoteSlot) / RegenerationPeriod)`   - Regeneration period varies by proposal category3. **Implementation Formula**```haskellVotingPower = BaseVotingPower * RegenerationFactorwhere:BaseVotingPower = UTXO value in lovelaceRegenerationFactor âˆˆ [0, 1]  -- Time-based recoverySystem Constants:StandardRegenerationPeriod = EpochLength            -- 5 daysPriorityRegenerationPeriod = EpochLength / 2.5     -- 2 daysEmergencyRegenerationPeriod = EpochLength / 5      -- 1 day```### Example Scenarios1. **Standard Proposal Vote**```haskellScenario:- UTXO Value: 1000 ADA- 2 days since last vote (40% of standard period)Calculation:BaseVotingPower = 1000 ADARegenerationFactor = 0.4  -- 40% regeneratedFinal VotingPower = 1000 * 0.4 = 400 ADA```2. **Emergency Proposal Vote**```haskellScenario:- Same UTXO: 1000 ADA- 2 days since last vote (200% of emergency period)Calculation:BaseVotingPower = 1000 ADARegenerationFactor = 1.0  -- Fully regenerated due to emergency timingFinal VotingPower = 1000 * 1.0 = 1000 ADA```### Basic Anti-Gaming Controls1. **UTXO Requirements**   - Minimum UTXO size: 100 ADA   - Basic tracking of voting history per UTXO2. **Regeneration Rules**   - Fixed rates per category   - No acceleration mechanisms   - Proposal categorization requires multi-signature verification3. **Emergency Controls**   - Emergency status requires verification from minimum 3 SPOs   - Limited number of concurrent emergency proposals (max 2)   - Automatic review period after emergency proposals## Risk Analysis### Key Risks1. **UTXO Manipulation**   - Risk Level: Low   - Impact: Moderate   - Mitigation: Basic UTXO tracking and minimum size requirements   - Note: All manipulations leave permanent evidence on-chain2. **System Gaming**   - Risk Level: Low   - Impact: Moderate   - Mitigation: Fixed regeneration rates and category verification   - Note: Emergency proposal abuse prevented by SPO verification3. **Category Misuse**   - Risk Level: Medium   - Impact: Moderate   - Mitigation: Multi-signature verification for category assignment   - Note: Regular audits of proposal categorization## Parameter Specifications| Parameter | Default Value | Description ||-----------|--------------|-------------|| Standard Regeneration Period | 5 days | Time for full recovery on standard proposals || Priority Regeneration Period | 2 days | Time for full recovery on priority proposals || Emergency Regeneration Period | 1 day | Time for full recovery on emergency proposals || Minimum UTXO Size | 100 ADA | Minimum size for voting UTXOs || Emergency Verifiers Required | 3 | Minimum SPOs needed to verify emergency status |### Parameter Justification1. **Time Periods**   - Standard period (5 days) aligns with epoch length for simplicity   - Priority period (2 days) balances urgency with consideration time   - Emergency period (1 day) allows quick response while preventing rushed decisions2. **UTXO Requirements**   - 100 ADA minimum prevents dust attack vectors   - Large enough to discourage gaming through splitting   - Small enough to maintain accessibility3. **Verification Requirements**   - Three SPO verification requirement provides a minimum threshold for consensus   - Multiple verifications help prevent individual SPO compromise or collusion   - Requirements can be adjusted through governance if needed   ## CopyrightThis CIP is licensed under CC-BY-4.0.
