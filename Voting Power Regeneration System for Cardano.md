Voters can use their full voting power immediately but must wait for a regeneration period afterward. Tracking occurs at the UTXO level, ensuring tamper-proof and transparent governance.## MotivationCurrent governance systems have several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed:1. Concentration of voting power among large stakeholders2. Limited participation incentives for smaller holders3. Lack of incentives for thoughtful voting4. Need for granular UTXO-level voting power tracking5. Chain reorganization impacts on voting recordsThe proposed system addresses these issues by:- Introducing voting power regeneration periods that affect all participants equally, regardless of stake size- Making each vote count through a "use it wisely" approach where voting power needs time to regenerate- Creating a transparent and verifiable voting history through UTXO tracking- Providing clear mechanisms for handling chain reorganizations## Specification### Core MechanismThe core mechanism introduces a voting power regeneration system that operates at the UTXO level. When a UTXO is used for voting, its voting power gradually regenerates over a specified period. This encourages thoughtful participation and prevents vote manipulation.#### Why UTXO-based?The UTXO model provides several advantages for voting power tracking:1. Atomic tracking: Each UTXO's voting power state can be tracked independently2. Natural inheritance: When UTXOs are combined or split, their voting power states can be inherited proportionally3. Immutable history: The UTXO model provides a clear audit trail of voting power usage4. Chain reorganization resilience: UTXO-based tracking makes it easier to handle chain reorganizations#### UTXO-based Voting Power Calculation```Available_Voting_Power =     Sum(Unused_UTXOs) +    Sum(Partially_Regenerated_UTXOs * Regeneration_Status) +    Sum(Delegated_Voting_Power)```Where:- Unused UTXOs are counted at full value- Used UTXOs are subject to regeneration time- New UTXOs inherit regeneration status proportionally from parent UTXOs- Partially regenerated UTXOs contribute proportionally to their regeneration status- Delegated voting power is subject to simple delegation rules#### Regeneration System```haskellUTXO_Status = min(    (Current_Slot - Voting_Slot) / Regeneration_Slots,    1.0)```#### UTXO Inheritance SystemWhen UTXOs are combined or split, their voting power regeneration status needs to be properly inherited to prevent manipulation. The inheritance system ensures fair and proportional transfer of voting power states.Example scenarios:1. Combining UTXOs: If you combine a fully regenerated UTXO (100%) with a partially regenerated one (50%), the new UTXO's regeneration status will be the weighted average based on the ADA amounts.2. Splitting UTXOs: When a UTXO is split, all resulting UTXOs inherit the same regeneration status as the parent.```haskelldata InheritanceConfig = InheritanceConfig {    maxParentUtxos :: Integer,  -- Maximum 5    minimumFragmentSize :: Integer,  -- 100 ADA    waitingPeriod :: Integer,  -- 24 hours in slots    emergencyWaitingPeriod :: Integer  -- 1 hour for emergency proposals}-- For combined UTXOsNew_UTXO_Status =     Sum(Parent_UTXO_Value * Parent_UTXO_Status) / Total_Value-- Example:-- UTXO1: 1000 ADA at 100% regeneration-- UTXO2: 500 ADA at 50% regeneration-- Combined UTXO Status = (1000 * 1.0 + 500 * 0.5) / 1500 = 83.3%```### Parameters1. Regeneration Times- Regular Proposals: 30 days- Emergency Proposals: 5 days- Minimum regeneration time: 48 hours (12 hours for emergencies)2. Minimum Requirements- Minimum voting amount: 100 ADA- Minimum holding period: 24 hours before voting- Maximum 10 UTXO operations per address per epoch3. Delegation System```haskelldata DelegationConfig = DelegationConfig {    maxDelegatees :: Integer,  -- Maximum 1 delegatee per address    minDelegationAmount :: Integer,  -- 100 ADA    delegationCooldown :: Integer  -- 24 hours between changes}```### Technical Implementation#### 1. Smart Contract Core```haskelldata VotingPowerState = VotingPowerState {    usedUtxos :: Map UTxORef VotingStatus,    activeProposals :: Map ProposalId ProposalInfo,    regenerationTimes :: Map ProposalType Integer,    inheritanceRules :: InheritanceConfig,    delegationState :: DelegationState,    stateVersion :: Integer}data VotingStatus = VotingStatus {    lastVoteSlot :: SlotNo,    proposalTypes :: Set ProposalType,    regenerationProgress :: Percentage,    parentUtxos :: Maybe (Map UTxORef Percentage),    lastUpdateSlot :: SlotNo,    delegationInfo :: Maybe DelegationInfo}```#### 2. Chain Reorganization Handler```haskellhandleReorg :: ChainPoint -> ChainPoint -> IO ()handleReorg oldTip newTip = do    commonAncestor <- findCommonAncestor oldTip newTip    votes <- rollbackVotes commonAncestor    delegations <- rollbackDelegations commonAncestor    reapplyVotes newTip    reapplyDelegations newTip    adjustRegenerationTimes votes```### Security MeasuresThe security measures are designed to prevent common attack vectors while maintaining system usability.1. Basic Attack PreventionCommon attack vectors and their mitigations:- UTXO splitting attacks: Prevented by maxSplitsPerEpoch limit- Quick flip voting: Prevented by minUtxoAge requirement- Vote manipulation through UTXO combinations: Prevented by operationCooldown- Flash loan attacks: Prevented by minimumVotingPeriod- Voting power concentration: Limited by votingPowerCap```haskelldata SecurityConfig = SecurityConfig {    minUtxoAge :: Integer,  -- 24 hours    maxSplitsPerEpoch :: Integer,  -- 10    operationCooldown :: Integer,  -- 24 hours    minimumVotingPeriod :: Integer,  -- 48 hours    votingPowerCap :: Percentage  -- Maximum voting power per address}```2. Monitoring System```haskelldata MonitoringSystem = MonitoringSystem {    performanceMetrics :: Set Metric,    securityAlerts :: AlertConfig,    healthChecks :: HealthCheckConfig}```### Integration Guidelines#### Wallet Integration```typescriptinterface VotingWallet {    // Query available voting power    getVotingPower(): Promise<{        total: BigNumber,        breakdown: Map<UTXORef, VotingStatus>,        delegatedPower: DelegatedPowerInfo    }>;    // Submit vote transaction    submitVote(        proposalId: string,        vote: Vote,        utxos: UTXO[],        delegationInfo?: DelegationInfo    ): Promise<TxHash>;    // Delegation management    delegateVotingPower(        delegatee: Address,        amount: BigNumber,        duration: Integer    ): Promise<DelegationResult>;}```## Implementation Timeline### Phase 1: Core Development (3 Months)1.
